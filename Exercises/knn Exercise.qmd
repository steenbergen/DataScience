## Overview

In this exercise, you will perform a $k$-nearest neighbor analysis of the 2023 World Happiness Report data [@helliwell2023World]. Your task is to predict the happiness score using the features in the data. For this purpose, you may ignore `continent` as a predictor.

# Problem Set

1.  Use cross-validation to tune the regression model. Show the performance for the various values of the tuning parameters.

2.  What are the optimal values of the tuning parameters?

3.  Re-fit the model for the optimal values of the tuning parameters. What is the predictive performance of the model in the test set?
